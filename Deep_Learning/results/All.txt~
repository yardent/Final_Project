266 Push in on Will who sees something O.S.
267 Will's P.O.V. reveals BOBBY CHAMPA and his friends walking down the street. One of them casually lobs a bottle into a wire garbage can. It SHATTERS and some of the glass hits a FEMALE PASSERBY who
268 CHUCKIE

299 Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby might remember him
300 "FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S ""LET'S GET IT ON"""
301 Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the hapless Champa out cold.
302 As soon as Will hits Bobby
303 Will is in trouble
304 When Will goes for one guy
305 Will is staggered and bleary
306 Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's boys from the hood of a car.
307 Contrary to what we might think
308 The fight is messy
309 In the end

495 CHUCKIE
496 To tell you the truth
497 CLARK
498 Elementary? Oh
499 Will and Billy come forward
500 CHUCKIE
501 All right
502 CLARK
503 There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly
504 be characterized as agrarian pre-capitalist and. 
505 Will
506 WILL
507 Of course that's your contention.
508 You're a first year grad student.
509 You just finished some Marxian historian
510 so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year
511 capital-forming effects of military mobilization.
512 CLARK
513 (taken aback)
514 Well
515 WILL
516 "Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inheriated wealth You got that from ""Work in Essex County"

529 SKYLAR
530 Well
531 WILL
532 I didn't mean you. Listen
533 SKYLAR
534 Here's my number.

538 WILL
539 Great

1279 Hello
1280 A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and sits.
1281 He lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally.
1282 SEAN (cont'd)
1283 Where are you from in Southie?
1284 WILL
1285 Did you buy all these books retail
1286 SEAN
1287 Have you read all these books
1288 WILL
1289 Probably not.
1290 SEAN
1291 (indicating a shelf)
1292 How about the ones on that shelf?
1293 Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.
1294 WILL
1295 Yeah
1296 SEAN
1297 What did you think?
1298 WILL

1303 WILL
1304 That must have taken you a long time.
1305 SEAN
1306 Yeah
1307 Sean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair and goes to the shelf.

1322 Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much.
1323 Stunt your growth.
1324 WILL
1325 You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
1326 Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence.

1377 SEAN
1378 Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
1379 WILL
1380 Maybe you married the wrong woman.
1381 SEAN
1382 Watch your mouth.
1383 WILL
1384 That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?

2329 Is that what you think.
2330 WILL
2331 .some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
2332 SKYLAR

2334 WILL
2335 At least you have a mother.
2336 SKYLAR
2337 Fuck you! You think I want this?
2338 That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
2339 WILL
2340 What the fuck am I afraid of?!
2341 SKYLAR
2342 You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
2343 WILL
2344 I'm not honest?

2492 SEAN

2497 WILL (cont'd)
2498 Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk
2499 (rapid fire)
2500 "Now the politicians are sayin' ""send in the Marines to secure the area"" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there"
2501 country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in
2502 his ass got his old job
2503 bathroom breaks.
2504 Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck. A cute
2505 time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.
2506 A beat.
2507 WILL (cont'd)
2508 So what'd I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure I'll eliminate the middle man. Why not just shoot my buddy
2509 SEAN
2510 Do you think you're alone?
2511 WILL
2512 What?

2533 That's what I'm saying
2534 WILL
2535 Oh
2536 SEAN
2537 Don't give me you line of shit.
2538 WILL
2539 I didn't want the job.
2540 SEAN
2541 It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But
2542 And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
2543 WILL
2544 I didn't ask for this.
2545 SEAN
2546 Nobody gets what they ask for
2547 WILL
2548 Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick

2714 LAMBEAU
2715 What problems does he have
2716 SEAN
2717 Why do you think he does that
2718 LAMBEAU
2719 He can handle the work
2720 SEAN
2721 Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
2722 LAMBEAU
2723 Oh
2724 SEAN
2725 And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those
2726 kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
2727 LAMBEAU
2728 Oh
2729 SEAN
2730  .And who do you think he's handling?
2731 He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this
2732 LAMBEAU
2733 Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure
2734 SEAN
2735 .I'm not angry at you.
2736 LAMBEAU
2737 .Yes you are
2738 And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
2739 SEAN
2740 .I don't have any anger at you.
2741 LAMBEAU
2742 Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life
2743 SEAN
2744 That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you
2745 following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
2746 LAMBEAU
2747 .Is that what this is about
2748 The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy.
2749 SEAN
2750 .I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
2751 LAMBEAU
2752 That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
2753 SEAN
2754 I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause
2755 he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him. I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
2756 LAMBEAU
2757 He won't be a failure!
2758 SEAN
2759 If you push him into something
2760 LAMBEAU
2761 You're wrong
2762 SEAN
2763 He's not you!
